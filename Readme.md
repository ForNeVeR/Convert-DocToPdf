Convert-DocToPdf
================

This is a PowerShell script to convert any files supported by Microsoft Word to
PDF. Requires Word 2007 at least.

Inspired by [this SuperUser answer](http://superuser.com/a/28303/286768).

Usage:

    PS> ./Convert-DocToPdf.ps1 /path/to/file.docx

It will save the file to the original location with `.pdf` extension.
